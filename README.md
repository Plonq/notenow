# NoteNow
NoteNow is a MacOS app, designed to allow you to quickly take temporary notes.

For example you could use it to:

* Take notes while on a call
* Pasting some text temporarily (to make sure you don't lose it by copying something else)
* Writing yourself a reminder for the near future while in the middle of something
* ... Or anything else an instant text field could be used for!

## Features
* Runs in the menu bar
* Global hotkey to open it
* Share the note using the MacOS share functionality

## TODO
* Auto start on login
* Unit/UI tests
* Design a real icon for the status bar
* Add option to display a badge (e.g. red circle) on the icon when there is a note, or perhaps manually toggled. Intended to solve the problem of "I gotta remember to deal with X soon but need to finish what I'm doing right now first"
