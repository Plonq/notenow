* Pasting some text temporarily (to make sure you don't lose it by copying something else)
* Writing yourself a reminder for the near future while in the middle of something
* ... Or anything else an instant text field could be used for!

## Features

* Global hotkey to open it
* Auto start on login
* Share the note using the MacOS share functionality
